# Scriven

A tool for logging goal-based activity. As any good scrivener would know, scrivening requires a [Ledger](https://github.com/jakofranko/ledger). Built using Backbone, Scriven is a client-side interface for a RESTful API, and Ledger is the API I use.

Scriven's front-end utilizes [Josh Avenir's](https://github.com/joshavanier) [Macian](https://github.com/joshavanier/macian) library for styling/layout.

## TODO

* Add inputs to the logger to allow for non-goal logs, descriptions, and duration
* Improve/add visualizations for month and weekly progress
* Detail view per day/week/month to allow for better analysis of unmet goals
* Add milestone functionality for one-time achievments related to specific goals
* Security layer for authenticating against Ledger
